# SkyDNS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skynetservices/skydns.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skynetservices/skydns)
*Version 2.5.3a*

SkyDNS is a distributed service for announcement and discovery of services built
on top of [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd). It utilizes DNS queries to
discover available services. This is done by leveraging SRV records in DNS, with
special meaning given to subdomains, priorities and weights.

This is the original [announcement blog
post](http://blog.gopheracademy.com/skydns) for version 1. Since then, SkyDNS
has seen some changes, most notably the ability to use etcd as a backend.
[Here you can find the SkyDNS2 announcement](http://miek.nl/posts/2014/Jun/08/announcing%20SkyDNS%20version%202/).


# Changes since version 1

SkyDNS2:

* Does away with Raft and uses etcd (which uses raft).
* Makes is possible to query arbitrary domain names.
* Is a thin layer above etcd, that translates etcd keys and values to the DNS.
* Does DNSSEC with NSEC3 instead of NSEC.

Note that bugs in SkyDNS1 will still be fixed, but the main development effort
will be focussed on version 2. [Version 1 of SkyDNS can be found
here](https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns1).


## Setup / Install

Download/compile and run etcd. See the documentation for etcd at <https://github.com/coreos/etcd>.

Then get and compile SkyDNS:

    go get github.com/skynetservices/skydns
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/skynetservices/skydns
    go build -v

SkyDNS' configuration is stored *in* etcd: but there are also flags and
environment variables you can set. To start SkyDNS, set the etcd machines with
the environment variable ETCD_MACHINES:

    export ETCD_MACHINES='http://192.168.0.1:4001,http://192.168.0.2:4001'
    ./skydns

If `ETCD_MACHINES` is not set, SkyDNS will default to using
`http://127.0.0.1:4001` to connect to etcd. Or you can use the flag `-machines`.
Auto-discovering new machines added to the network can be enabled by enabling
the flag `-discover`.

Optionally (but recommended) give it a nameserver:

    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/dns/ns/ns1 \
        -d value='{"host":"192.168.0.1"}'

Also see the section "NS Records".


## Configuration

SkyDNS' configuration is stored in etcd as a JSON object under the key
`/skydns/config`. The following parameters may be set:

* `dns_addr`: IP:port on which SkyDNS should listen, defaults to `127.0.0.1:53`.
* `domain`: domain for which SkyDNS is authoritative, defaults to `skydns.local.`.
* `dnssec`: enable DNSSEC
* `hostmaster`: hostmaster email address to use.
* `local`: optional unique value for this skydns instance, default is none. This is returned
    when queried for `local.dns.skydns.local`.
* `round_robin`: enable round-robin sorting for A and AAAA responses, defaults to true.
    Note that packets containing more than one CNAME are exempt from this (see issue #128 on Github).
* `nameservers`: forward DNS requests to these (recursive) nameservers (array of IP:port combination),
    when not authoritative for a domain. This defaults to the servers listed in `/etc/resolv.conf`. Also
    see `no_rec`.
* `no_rec`: never (ever) provide a recursive service (i.e. forward to the servers provided in -nameservers).
* `read_timeout`: network read timeout, for DNS and talking with etcd.
* `ttl`: default TTL in seconds to use on replies when none is set in etcd, defaults to 3600.
* `min_ttl`: minimum TTL in seconds to use on NXDOMAIN, defaults to 30.
* `scache`: the capacity of the DNSSEC signature cache, defaults to 10000 signatures if not set.
* `rcache`: the capacity of the response cache, defaults to 0 messages if not set.
* `rcache_ttl`: the TTL of the response cache, defaults to 60 if not set.
* `systemd`: bind to socket(s) activated by systemd (ignores -addr).
* `path-prefix`: backend(etcd) path prefix, defaults to skydns (i.e. if it is set to `mydns`, the SkyDNS's configuration object should be stored under the key `/mydns/config`).

To set the configuration, use something like:

    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/config \
        -d value='{"dns_addr":"127.0.0.1:5354","ttl":3600, "nameservers": ["8.8.8.8:53","8.8.4.4:53"]}'

SkyDNS needs to be restarted for configuration changes to take effect. This
might change, so that SkyDNS can re-read the config from etcd after a HUP
signal.

You can also use the command line options, however the settings in etcd take
precedence.


### Commandline flags

* `-addr`: used to specify the address to listen on (note: this will be changed into `-dns_addr` to match the json.
* `-local`: used to specify a unique service for this SkyDNS instance. This should point to a (unique) domain into etcd, when
    SkyDNS receives a query for the name `local.dns.skydns.local` it will fetch this service and return it.
    For instance: `-local e2016c14-fbba-11e3-ae08-10604b7efbe2.dockerhosts.skydns.local` and then

        curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/dockerhosts/e2016c14-fbba-11e3-ae08-10604b7efbe2 \
            -d value='{"host":"10.1.1.16"}'

    To register the local IP address. Now when SkyDNS receives a query for local.dns.skydns.local it will fetch the above
    key and returns that one service. In other words skydns will substitute `e2016c14-fbba-11e3-ae08-10604b7efbe2.dockerhosts.skydns.local`
    for `local.dns.skydns.local`. This follows the same rules as the other services, so it can also be an external names, which
    will be resolved.

    Also see the section Host Local Values.


### Environment Variables

SkyDNS uses these environment variables:

* `ETCD_MACHINES` - list of etcd machines, "http://localhost:4001,http://etcd.example.com:4001". Overwrite with `-machines` string flag.
* `ETCD_TLSKEY` - path of TLS client certificate - private key. Overwrite with `-tls-key` string flag.
* `ETCD_TLSPEM` - path of TLS client certificate - public key. Overwrite with `-tls-pem` string flag.
* `ETCD_CACERT` - path of TLS certificate authority public key. Overwrite with `-ca-cert` string flag.
* `SKYDNS_ADDR` - specify address to bind to. Overwrite with `-addr` string flag.
* `SKYDNS_DOMAIN` - set a default domain if not specified by etcd config. Overwrite with `-domain` string flag.
* `SKYDNS_NAMESERVERS` - set a list of nameservers to forward DNS requests to
  when not authoritative for a domain, "8.8.8.8:53,8.8.4.4:53". Overwrite with `-nameservers` string flag.
* `SKYDNS_PATH_PREFIX` - backend(etcd) path prefix, defaults to skydns (i.e. if it is set to `mydns`, the SkyDNS's configuration object should be stored under the key `/mydns/config`). Overwrite with `-path-prefix` string flag.
* `SKYDNS_SYSTEMD`: set to `true` to bind to socket(s) activated by systemd (ignores SKYDNS_ADDR). Overwrite with `-systemd` bool flag.

For [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io/) the following environment variables
are available:

* `PROMETHEUS_PORT`: port where the HTTP server for prometheus will run.
* `PROMETHEUS_PATH`: path for the metrics, defaults to `/metrics`.
* `PROMETHEUS_NAMESPACE`: namespace used in the metrics, no default.
* `PROMETHEUS_SUBSYSTEM`: subsystem used in the metric, defaults to `skydns`.

If `PROMETHEUS_PORT` is set to an integer larger than 0, Prometheus support will
be enabled.

Current counters are:

*  `dns_request_count_total`, total count of request made against SkyDNS.
*  `dns_request_duration_seconds`, duration of the request handling in seconds.
*  `dns_response_size_bytes`, size of the repsonses in bytes.
*  `dns_error_count_total`, total count of responses containing errors.
*  `dns_cachemiss_count_total`, total count of cache misses.

### SSL Usage and Authentication with Client Certificates

In order to connect to an SSL-secured etcd, you will at least need to set
ETCD_CACERT to be the public key of the Certificate Authority which signed the
server certificate.

If the SSL-secured etcd expects client certificates to authorize connections,
you also need to set ETCD_TLSKEY to the *private* key of the client, and
ETCD_TLSPEM to the *public* key of the client.


## Service Announcements

Announce your service by submitting JSON over HTTP to etcd with information
about your service. This information will then be available for queries via DNS.
We use the directory `/skydns` to anchor all names.

When providing information you will need to fill out (some of) the following
values.

* Path - The path of the key in etcd, e.g. if the domain you want to
  register is "rails.production.east.skydns.local", you need to reverse it
  and replace the dots with slashes. So the name here becomes:
    `local/skydns/east/production/rails`.
  Then prefix the `/skydns/` string too, so the final path becomes
    `/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/east/production/rails`
* Host - The name of your service, e.g., `service5.mydomain.com` or an IP address (either v4 or v6);
* Port - the port where the service can be reached;
* Priority - the priority of the service, the lower the value, the more preferred;
* Weight - a weight factor that will be used for services with the same Priority;
* Text - text you want to add (this returned when doing a TXT query);
* TTL - the time-to-live of the service, overriding the default TTL. If the etcd
  key also has a TTL, the minimum of this value and the etcd TTL is used.
* TargetStrip - when synthesising a name for an IP only SRV record, take the path
  name and strip `TargetStrip` labels from the ride hand side.
* Group - limit recursion and only return services that share the Group's value.

Path is the only mandatory field. The lookups into Etcd will be done with
a *lower* cased path name.

Adding the service can thus be done with:

    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/east/production/rails \
        -d value='{"host":"service5.example.com","priority":20}'

Or with [`etcdctl`](https://github.com/coreos/etcdctl):

    etcdctl set /skydns/local/skydns/east/production/rails \
        '{"host":"service5.example.com","priority":20}'

When doing a SRV query for these keys an SRV record is returned with the
priority and a certain weight. The weight of a service is calculated as follows.
We treat weight as a percentage, so if there are
3 services, the weight is set to 33 for each:

| Service | Weight  | SRV.Weight |
| --------| ------- | ---------- |
|    a    |   100   |    33      |
|    b    |   100   |    33      |
|    c    |   100   |    33      |

If we add other weights to the equation some services will get a different
Weight:

| Service | Weight  | SRV.Weight |
| --------| ------- | ---------- |
|    a    |   120   |    34      |
|    b    |   100   |    28      |
|    c    |   130   |    37      |

Note, all calculations are rounded down, so the sum total might be lower than
100.

When querying the DNS for services you can use wildcards or query for
subdomains. See the section named "Wildcards" below for more information.


## Service Discovery via the DNS

You can find services by querying SkyDNS via any DNS client or utility. It uses
a known domain syntax with subdomains to find matching services.

For the purpose of this document, let's suppose we have added the following
services to etcd:

* 1.rails.production.east.skydns.local, mapping to service1.example.com
* 2.rails.production.west.skydns.local, mapping to service2.example.com
* 4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local, mapping to 10.0.1.125
* 6.rails.staging.east.skydns.local, mapping to 2003::8:1

These names can be added with:

    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/east/production/rails/1 \
        -d value='{"host":"service1.example.com","port":8080}'
    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/west/production/rails/2 \
        -d value='{"host":"service2.example.com","port":8080}'
    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/east/staging/rails/4 \
        -d value='{"host":"10.0.1.125","port":8080}'
    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/east/staging/rails/6 \
        -d value='{"host":"2003::8:1","port":8080}'

Testing one of the names with `dig`:

    % dig @localhost SRV 1.rails.production.east.skydns.local

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    1.rails.production.east.skydns.local. 3600 IN SRV 10 0 8080 service1.example.com.


### Wildcards

Of course using the full names isn't *that* useful, so SkyDNS lets you query for
subdomains, and returns responses based upon the amount of services matched by
the subdomain or from the wildcard query.

If we are interested in all the servers in the `east` region, we simply omit the
rightmost labels from our query:

    % dig @localhost SRV east.skydns.local

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    east.skydns.local.      3600    IN      SRV     10 20 8080 service1.example.com.
    east.skydns.local.      3600    IN      SRV     10 20 8080 4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local.
    east.skydns.local.      3600    IN      SRV     10 20 8080 6.rails.staging.east.skydns.local.

    ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
    4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local. 3600 IN A    10.0.1.125
    6.rails.staging.east.skydns.local. 3600 IN AAAA 2003::8:1

Here all three entries of the `east` are returned.

There is one other feature at play here. The second and third names,
`{4,6}.rails.staging.east.skydns.local`, only had an IP record configured. Here
SkyDNS used the etcd path (also see `TargetStrip`) to
construct a target name and then puts the actual IP address in the additional
section. Directly querying for the A records of
`4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local.` of course also works:

    % dig @localhost -p 5354 +noall +answer A 4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local.

    4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local. 3600 IN A    10.0.1.125

Another way to leads to the same result it to query for `*.east.skydns.local`,
you even put the wildcard (the `*` or `any`) in the middle of a name
`staging.*.skydns.local` or `staging.any.skydns.local` is a valid query, which
returns all name in staging, regardless of the region. Multiple wildcards per
name are also permitted.

Note that `any` is synonymous for a `*`, as shown above.


### Examples

Now we can try some of our example DNS lookups:


#### SRV Records

Get all Services in staging.east:

    % dig @localhost staging.east.skydns.local. SRV

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    staging.east.skydns.local. 3600 IN  SRV 10 50 8080 4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local.
    staging.east.skydns.local. 3600 IN  SRV 10 50 8080 6.rails.staging.east.skydns.local.

    ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
    4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local. 3600 IN A    10.0.1.125
    6.rails.staging.east.skydns.local. 3600 IN AAAA 2003::8:1

If you ask for a service who's Host value is an IP address you would (in theory) get
back a SRV record such as:

    % dig @localhost 4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local SRV

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local 3600 IN SRV 10 100 8080 10.0.1.125

Where the target of the SRV is an IP address. This is not how SRV records work.
SkyDNS will in this case synthesize a domain name and add the actual IP
address to the additional section of the response:

    % dig @localhost 4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local SRV

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local 3600 IN SRV 10 100 4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local.

    ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
    4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local. 3600 IN A    10.0.1.125

Which conveys the same information and is legal in the DNS. To have some control on how
the target names look you can register a service with `TargetStrip` set to a non-zero
value. Setting TargetStrip to "2" strips 2 labels from the generated target name:

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local 3600 IN SRV 10 100 staging.east.skydns.local.

    ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
    staging.east.skydns.local. 3600 IN A    10.0.1.125

Which removed the `4.rails` from the target name.

#### A/AAAA Records
To return A records, simply run a normal DNS query for a service matching the
above patterns.

Now do a normal DNS query:

    % dig @localhost staging.east.skydns.local. A

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    staging.east.skydns.local. 3600 IN  A   10.0.1.125

Now you have a list of all known IP Addresses registered running in staging in
the east area.

Because we're returning A records and not SRV records, there are no ports
listed, so this is only useful when you're querying for services running on
ports known to you in advance.


#### MX Records

If a service is added with `"mail": true` it is *also* an MX record, the Priority
doubles as the MX's Preference.


#### CNAME Records

If for an A or AAAA query the IP address can not be parsed, SkyDNS will try to
see if there is a chain of names that will lead to an IP address. The chain can
not be longer than 8. So for instance if the following services have been
registered:

    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/east/production/rails/1 \
        -d value='{"host":"service1.skydns.local","port":8080}'

and

    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/service1 \
        -d value='{"host":"10.0.2.15","port":8080}'

We have created the following CNAME chain:
`1.rails.production.east.skydns.local` -> `service1.skydns.local` ->
`10.0.2.15`. If you then query for an A or AAAA for
1.rails.production.east.skydns.local SkyDNS returns:

    1.rails.production.east.skydns.local. 3600  IN  CNAME   service1.skydns.local.
    service1.skydns.local.                 3600  IN  A       10.0.2.15


##### External Names

If the CNAME chains leads to a name that falls outside of the domain (i.e. does
not end with `skydns.local.`), a.k.a. an external name, SkyDNS will attempt to
resolve that name using the supplied nameservers. If this succeeds the reply is
concatenated to the current one and send to the client. So if we register this
service:

    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/east/production/rails/1 \
        -d value='{"host":"www.miek.nl","port":8080}'

Doing an A/AAAA query for this will lead to the following response:

    1.rails.production.east.skydns.local. 3600 IN CNAME www.miek.nl.
    www.miek.nl.            3600    IN      CNAME   a.miek.nl.
    a.miek.nl.              3600    IN      A       176.58.119.54

The first CNAME is generated from within SkyDNS, the other CNANE is returned
from the remote name server.


#### TXT Records

SkyDNS also allows you to query for TXT records. Just register a json with the
'text' field set.


#### NS Records

For DNS to work properly SkyDNS needs to tell its parents its nameservers. This
information is stored inside etcd, under the key `local/skydns/dns/ns`. There
multiple services maybe stored. Note these services MUST use IP address, using
names will not work. For instance:

    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/dns/ns/ns1 \
        -d value='{"host":"172.16.0.1"}'

Registers `ns1.ns.dns.skydns.local` as a nameserver with IP address 172.16.0.1:

    % dig @localhost NS skydns.local

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    skydns.local.       3600    IN  NS  ns1.ns.dns.skydns.local.

    ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
    n1.ns.dns.skydns.local.    3600    IN  A   172.16.0.1

Having the nameserver(s) in etcd make sense because usually it is hard for
SkyDNS to figure this out by itself, especially when running behind NAT or
running on 127.0.0.1:53 and being forwarded packets IPv6 packets, etc. etc.


#### PTR Records: Reverse Addresses

When registering a service with an IP address only, you might also want to
register the reverse (adding a hostname the address points to). In the DNS these
records are called PTR records.

So looking back at some of the services in the section "Service Discovery via
the DNS", we register these IP only ones:

    4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local. 10.0.1.125

To add the reverse of this address you need to add the DNS name that will be used
when doing a reverse lookup. With `dig -x <IP address>` you can easiliy find
what the reverse name should be:

    % dig -x 10.0.1.125 +noall +question
    ;125.1.0.10.in-addr.arpa.   IN  PTR

So the name must be `125.1.0.10.in-addr.arpa` which should point to
`4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local`.

These can be added with the following command. Note that the IP address is
reversed *again* and is actually back in its original form.

    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/arpa/in-addr/10/0/1/125 \
        -d value='{"host":"4.rails.staging.east.skydns.local"}'

If SkyDNS receives a PTR query it will check these paths and will return the
contents. Note that these replies are sent with the AA (Authoritative Answer)
bit *off*. If nothing is found locally the query is forwarded to the local
recursor (if so configured), otherwise SERVFAIL is returned.

This also works for IPv6 addresses, except that the reverse path is quite long.


#### DNS Forwarding

By specifying nameservers in SkyDNS's config, for instance
`8.8.8.8:53,8.8.4.4:53`, you create a DNS forwarding proxy. In this case it
round-robins between the two nameserver IPs mentioned.

Requests for which SkyDNS isn't authoritative will be forwarded and proxied back
to the client. This means that you can set SkyDNS as the primary DNS server in
`/etc/resolv.conf` and use it for both service discovery and normal DNS
operations.


#### DNSSEC

SkyDNS supports signing DNS answers, also known as DNSSEC. To use it, you need
to create a DNSSEC keypair and use that in SkyDNS. For instance, if the domain
for SkyDNS is `skydns.local`:

    % dnssec-keygen skydns.local
    Generating key pair............++++++ ...................................++++++
    Kskydns.local.+005+49860

This creates two files with the basename `Kskydns.local.+005.49860`, one with
the extension `.key` (this holds the public key) and one with the extension
`.private` which holds the private key. The basename of these files should be
given to SkyDNS's DNSSEC configuration option like so (together with some other
options):

    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/config -d \
        value='{"dns_addr":"127.0.0.1:5354","dnssec":"Kskydns.local.+005+55656"}'

If you then query with `dig +dnssec` you will get signatures, keys and NSEC3
records returned. Authenticated denial of existence is implemented using NSEC3
white lies, see [RFC7129](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7129), Appendix B.


#### Host Local Values

SkyDNS supports storing values which are specific for that *instance* of SkyDNS.

This can be useful when you have SkyDNS running on multiple hosts, but want to
store values that are specific for a single host. For example the public
IP-address of the host or the IP-address on the tenant network.

To do that you need to specify a unique value for that host with `-local`.
A good unique value for that would be an UUID which you can generate with
`uuidgen` for instance.

That unique value is used as a path in etcd to store the values separately from
the normal values. It is still stored in the etcd backend so a restart of SkyDNS
with the same unique value will give it access to the old data.

In the example here, we don't use an UUID, we use `public.addresses`:

    % skydns -local public.addresses.skydns.local &

    % curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/local/addresses/public \
        -d value='{"host":"192.0.2.1"}'

    % dig @127.0.0.1 local.dns.skydns.local. A

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    local.dns.skydns.local. 3600 IN  A   192.0.2.1

The name `local.dns.skydns.local.` is fixed, i.e. you can retrieve the Host
Local Value by querying for `local.dns.<your domain>`.


#### Groups

Groups can be used to group set of services together. The main use of this is to
limit recursion, i.e. don't give back *all* records, but only a subset. Say that
I have configuration like this:

    /skydns/local/domain/
    /skydns/local/domain/a - {"host": "127.0.0.1", "group": "g1"}
    /skydns/local/domain/b - {"host": "127.0.0.2", "group": "g1"}
    /skydns/local/domain/subdom/
    /skydns/local/domain/subdom/c - {"host": "127.0.0.3", "group": "g2"}
    /skydns/local/domain/subdom/d - {"host": "127.0.0.4", "group": "g2"}

And you want `domain.local` to return (127.0.0.1 and 127.0.0.2) and
`subdom.domain.local` to return (127.0.0.3 and 127.0.0.4). For this the two
domains, need to be in different groups. What those groups are does not matter,
as long as `a` and `b` belong to the same group which is *different* from the
group `c` and `d` belong to. If a service is found *without* a group it is
*always included*.


## Implementing a custom DNS backend

The SkyDNS `server` package may be used as a library, which allows a custom
record retrieval implementation (referred to as a `Backend`) to be provided. The
default Etcd implementation resides under `backends/etcd/etcd.go`. To provide
your own backend implementation, you must implement the `server.Backend`
interface.

If you want to preserve the ability to answer arbitrary queries from etcd, but use
your custom implementation for certain subsets of the namespace, the
`server.FirstBackend` helper type will allow you to chain multiple `Backends` in
order. The first backend that answers a `Records` or `ReverseRecord` call with
a record and with no error will be served.


## Stub Zones

Stub Zones are pointers that point to *another set* of servers which should
provide an answer for the current query. This is similar to the (recursive)
forwarding SkyDNS does, but different in that you need to specify a domain name
and a set of authoritative servers. Also this can be dynamically controlled by
writing values into Etcd. Note, that when enabled SkyDNS will *first* consult
the stub configuration, potentially bypassing any configured local records.

The stub zone configuration lives under `stub.dns.skydns.local.`. The following
example shows on how to set this up. Suppose we want to create a stub zone for
`skydns.com` and point to the nameservers reachable by following address *and*
(optional) ports:

* 172.16.1.1, port 54
* 10.10.244.1, port 53 (53 is the default that will be used if there isn't one
    specified)

We should then register 2 services under the name `skydns.com.stub.dns.skydns.local`

    % curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/dns/stub/com/skydns/ns1 \
        -d value='{"host":"172.16.1.1", "port":54}'
    % curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/dns/stub/com/skydns/ns2 \
        -d value='{"host":"10.10.244.1"}'

So the *leaves* should have the nameserver information.

    xxx.<domain name>.stub.dns.skydns.local
    |           |
    v           |
    nameservers |
                v
          stub domain name

When SkyDNS receives a query for `skydns.com` it will *not* forward it to the
recursors, but instead will query 172.16.1.1 on port 54 and if that fails will
query 10.10.244.1 (on 53) to get an answer. That answer will then be given back
to the original client.

When forwarding to a stub, SkyDNS adds a EDNS0 meta data RR to the packet
telling the remote server (if its a SkyDNS instance) that this is a stub request.
SkyDNS will not (stub)forward packets with this EDNS0 meta data, instead the request
will be dropped and logged.

Remember this will only work when SkyDNS is started with `-stubzones`.


## How Do I Create an Address Pool and Round Robin Between Them

You have 3 machines with 3 different IP addresses and you want to have
1 name pointing to all 3 possible addresses. The name we want to use is:
  `db.skydns.local` and the 3 addresses are 127.0.0.{1,2,3}. For this to work we
  create the hosts named `x{1,2,3}.db.skydns.local` in etcd:

    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/db/x1 -d \
        value='{"host":"127.0.0.1"}'
    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/db/x2 -d \
        value='{"host": "127.0.0.2"'}
    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/db/x3 -d \
        value='{"host": "127.0.0.3"'}

Now the name `db.skydns.local` is the "load balanced" name for the database, SkyDNS
will round-robin by default in this case unless `-round-robin=false` is enabled.


## How I Do Create Multiple SRV Records For the Same Name

You want this response from SkyDNS, which says there are 2 open
ports on bar.skydns.local and this name has IP addres 192.168.0.1:

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    bar.skydns.local.   3600    IN  SRV 10 50 80 bar.skydns.local.
    bar.skydns.local.   3600    IN  SRV 10 50 443 bar.skydns.local.

    ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
    bar.skydns.local. 3600    IN  A   192.168.0.1

So you register a "dummy" host named `x1`:

    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/bar/x1 -d \
        value='{"host":"192.168.0.1","port":80}'
    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/bar/x2 -d \
        value='{"host": "bar.skydns.local","port":443}'

And try it out:

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    bar.skydns.local.   3600    IN  SRV 10 50 80 x1.bar.skydns.local.
    bar.skydns.local.   3600    IN  SRV 10 50 443 bar.skydns.local.

    ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
    x1.bar.skydns.local. 3600    IN  A   192.168.0.1

Which has `x1` in the name, which is not the name you wanted to see there, and
worse does not match the name in the other SRV record. To makes this work you'll
need `TargetStrip` which allows you to tell SkyDNS to strip labels from the name
it makes up:

    curl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/skydns/local/skydns/bar/x1 -d \
        value='{"host":"192.168.0.1","port":80,"targetstrip":1}'

    % dig @127.0.0.1 bar.skydns.local. SRV

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    bar.skydns.local.   3600    IN  SRV 10 50 80 bar.skydns.local.
    bar.skydns.local.   3600    IN  SRV 10 50 443 bar.skydns.local.

    ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
    bar.skydns.local. 3600    IN  A   192.168.0.1


## How do you limit recursion?

By default SkyDNS will returns *all* records under a name. Suppose you want we have
`bar.skydns.local`... TODO.


# Docker

Official Docker images are at the [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/skynetservices/skydns/):

* master -> skynetservices/skydns:latest
* latest tag -> skynetservices/skydns:latest-tagged

The supplied `Dockerfile` can be used to build an image as well. Note that the image
is based of Alpine Linux which used musl libc instead of glibc, so when building
SkyDNS you must make sure if does not need glibc when run:

Build SkyDNS with:

    % GOOS=linux go build -a -tags netgo -installsuffix netgo

And then build the docker image:

    % docker build -t $USER/skydns .

If you run it, SkyDNS needs to access Etcd (or whatever backend), which usually
runs on the host server (i.e. when using CoreOS), to make that work, just run:

    docker run --net host <image>
