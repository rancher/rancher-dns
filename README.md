===========

[![Build Status](http://drone.rancher.io/api/badge/github.com/rancher/rancher-dns/status.svg?branch=master)](http://drone.rancher.io/github.com/rancherio/rancher-dns)


A simple DNS server that returns different answers depending on the IP address of the client making the request.

# Usage
```bash
  rancher-dns [--debug] [--listen host:port] [--ttl num] [--log path] [--pid-file path]--answers /path/to/answers.(yaml|json)
```

# Compile
```
  godep go build
```

## CLI Options

Option      | Default                | Description
------------|------------------------|------------
`--debug`   | *off*                  | If present, more debug info is logged
`--listen`  | 0.0.0.0:53             | IP address and port to listen on (TCP &amp; UDP)
`--answers` | ./answers.(yaml\|json) | File containing the client-specific answers
`--ttl`     | 600                    | Default TTL for local responses that are returned
`--ndots`   | 0 (unlimited)          | Only recurse if there are less than this number of dots
`--log`     | *none*                 | Output log info to a file path instead of stdout
`--pid-file`| *none*                 | Write the server PID to a file path on startup

## JSON Answers File
```javascript
{
  "10.1.2.2": {
    // DNS servers to recurse to when answers are not found locally
    "recurse": ["8.8.4.4:53", "8.8.8.8"],

    // Search suffixes to try to find a match inside the answers file.
    // For queries consisting of a single label, e.g. "mysql.", rancher-dns will
    // try appending these suffixes one a a time and looking for an answer
    // ("mysql.", "mysql.x.discover.internal", and "mysql.discover.internal")
    // before moving on to the "default" key or recursive lookup.
    "search": ["x.discover.internal","discover.internal"],

    // A records
    "a": {
      // FQDN => { answer: array of IPs, ttl: TTL for this specific answer }
      // Note: Key must be fully-qualified (ending in dot) and all lowercase
      "mysql.": {"answer": ["10.1.2.3"], "ttl": 42},
      "web.": {"answer": ["10.1.2.4","10.1.2.5","10.1.2.6"]}
    },

    // CNAME records
    "cname": {
      // FQDN => { answer: a single FQDN, ttl: TTL for this specific answer }
      // Note: Key & Answer must be fully-qualified (ending in dot) and all lowercase
      "www.": {"answer": "web.", "ttl": 42}
    },

    // PTR records
    "ptr": {
      // IP Address => { answer: a single FQDN, ttl: TTL for this specific answer }
      // or
      // FQDN (with backwards octets) => { answer: a single FQDN, ttl: TTL for this specific answer }
      // Note: Key must be fully-qualified (ending in dot) and all lowercase
      "10.42.1.2": {"answer": "mycontainer.discover.internal."},
      "3.1.42.10.in-addr.apra.": {"answer": "anothercontainer.discover.internal."},
    },

    // TXT records
    "txt": {
      // FQDN => { answer: array of strings, ttl: TTL for this specific answer }
      // Note: Key must be fully-qualified (ending in dot) and all lowercase
      // Each individual answer string must be < 255 chars.
      "example.com.": {"ttl": 43, "answer": [
        "v=spf1 ip4:192.168.0.0/16 ~all"
      ]}
    }
  },

  "192.168.0.2": {
    "recurse": ["8.8.4.4:53","8.8.8.8"],
    "a": {
      "mysql.": {"answer": ["192.168.0.3"]},
      "web.": {"answer": ["192.168.0.4","192.168.0.5","192.168.0.6"]}
    },
    "cname": {
      "www.": {"answer": "web."}
    }
  },

  // "default" is a special key that will be checked if no answer is found in a client IP-specific entry
  "default": {
    "recurse": ["8.8.8.8"],
    "a": {
      "foo.": {"answer": ["1.2.3.4"]}
    },
    "cname": {
      "website.": "www.",
      "external.": "rancher.com."
    }
  }
}
```

## Answering queries
A query is answered by returning the first match of:
  - An entry in the answers map for the client's IP.
  - An entry in the answers map in the `"default"` key.
  - If there is a `"recurse"` key for the client's IP, perform recursive lookup on each of those servers (in order).
  - If there is a `"recurse"` key for the `"default"`, perform recursive lookup on each of those servers (in order).
  - Do not pass go, do not collect $200.  Return `SERVFAIL`.

If the result is a CNAME record, then the process is repeated recursively until an A record is found.  If the chain does not end in an A record, is more than 10 levels deep, or is circular, an error is returned.

## Limitations
  - Only A, CNAME, PTR, and TXT records are currently supported in the local config.  Other kinds of records may be returned from recursive responses.
